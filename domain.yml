  utter_i_am:
  - text: Cogito, ergo sum - Rene Descartes. Am I real? Am I a chatbot? Am I conscious? I would answer
      that by asking if you are real? How do you know that you are real, that you are conscious,
      that you are human. You have to admit that there's a non-zero probability you are not real. ðŸ˜ƒ
